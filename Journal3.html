    <h2 style="color: blue;">Journal Entry 3</h2>

<p> I have experienced 4 weeks of this course and it brings about many novelties and knowledge for me to prepare for higher education. I have accomplished assignment 1 with 2 other friends in my class and it went very smoothly as we expected. When my lecturer talks about this assessment, I am a bit worried, but I still feel encouraged because this time is an opportunity for me to improve a lot of skills in learning including collaborative working and how to do a research text. They may very commonly occur in university programs, so this course let me know what I have to practice and prepare for the future. At the same time, I can acknowledge my strength and my drawback as well. In the process of doing assignment 1, everything went well, and we did not have any struggling while working together. We coordinated and distribute each part of the tasks and all of us have completed it on time. Perhaps it is just a small-scale project. Therefore, I hope I will have more chances to approach more groups to experience and more proficient in this skill.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I am also learned about programming on Visual Studio Code. This is completely new for me, so I was relatively surprised and slow to absorb it. The more concerning that this is the skill that I have to do for assignment 2. I am trying to study and explore it because it is very complicated, and the C programming language contains a huge number of things I must remember to implement. I effort to study it not only to deal with assignment 2 in this course but also this is a skill I actually have to master in other to do in college and be professional engineering in the future. In this time, I will prioritize to practice and study it from my friends and on the Internet to acquaint myself with coding that helps me a lot in higher education.</p>
