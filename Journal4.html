    <h2>Journal Entry 4</h2>   
       <p>Until this week, I have experienced 5 weeks of these courses in my first semester at RMIT. As everyone knows, the covid 19 has once again recurred in Vietnam and Ho Chi Minh city where my university is located is also among that. The new virus variant is gradually getting stronger, and we have confronted many adverse situations. Therefore, not only my school but also all of the schools in the outbreak are transferred to online learning. I feel that studying online brings a lot of trouble and obstacles for me. Because these last lectures in this course are steadily getting more difficult and complicated. For example, in some recent practice sessions, it would be easier to approach these skills such as coding or creating a website if I am learned in a face-to-face class, it is more convenient for my lecturer to directly guide me each step of the process, and I can observe obviously. Additionally, network issues commonly happen in online courses. Several typical problems such as my online classroom are interrupted due to poor connection that makes it hard to listen and acquire the information. Regularly, about the lesson slides, although it has been moved to other pages, I can still only see the previous slides which my teacher has talked about, which lead to confusion about what he was talking about. It causes decreased learning performance. Besides, the knowledge of these lectures is gradually advance and become more complex, so language is a problem for me at the moment. I assume that English is my weakness in the University program. Sometimes, I am confused about some vocabulary and technical words. There are numerous kinds of languages I have to remember, which makes it hard to understand the content of lectures. For instance, this week I am learned with guest lecturers, they teach very enthusiastically, and I am also receptive. However, the lecture includes a lot of technical languages and there are advanced pieces of knowledge. Therefore, at some points, I have still not caught them, and I spend a little time after to review them on slides at Canvas or extend research on the internet.</p>
 
    <p>In brief, I will spend more time practicing and enhancing my second language that may promote my study ability more efficiently. Perhaps, the pandemic circumstance will go on and get more serious, so I have to attempt more actively in learning by asking lecturers about which parts I have still not embraced yet, seeking a place to have a sustained connection.
