        <h2>Journal Entry 1</h2>
        <p>My intention after graduating high school was to study medicine under the direction of my parents. However, I recognized that my passion branch in science and technology. From when I was a child until now, I feel excited when I watch channels relevant to technology like car manufacturing or AI, which is very cool. Fortunately, my parents also approved my determination and chose RMIT because they heard that the facilities at RMIT are very modern and appropriate for this major. It would be an opportunity for me to become a qualified engineer and have a favorable career path.
 
            Since I have begun entry to the RMIT campus, it is indeed more imposing than I imagined. In the first days when I experience studying here, I am surprised and highly enthusiastic to see a lot of technological conveniences are available equipped on campus such as numerous high-ends computer labs where every RMIT student are allowed to use and labs for each major, especially is IT and engineering labs where I will stick regularly during college. The majority are located in building 2 and 8 on campus. Particularly, not everyone is allowed to use these function rooms for safety reasons. Therefore, I and all the engineering students are required to accomplish Organizational Health & Safety (OH&S). Then, I will receive the access card to enter these rooms. This training is extremely important and useful because accidents in labs are commonly happening such as electric shocks, burns caused by fire, bleeding from cutting, or stepping on a sharp object. Throughout this, I can learn how to avoid misfortune and first aid techniques when I confront these circumstances. Not only position of strength about facilities but also study support services like Student Academic Success (SAS) or library. I can contact lecturers on these services to get support or booking appointments with them. Also, I can access SAS and the library website to get information. For example, when I donâ€™t know how to make citations and references, I can seek guidance from easy cities on the library website. Additionally, the NEO culture tech club and student developer club are typical organizations on the campus where I can engage to exchange knowledge about my specialty and to entertain. 
             
            In brief, through several courses in RMIT, I have discovered many new things for me and that will be helpful for my educational paths in the future.

        <h2>Journal Entry 2</h2>    
        <p>Currently, I am studying the second subject in the first semester that is Introduction to Science and Technology. This class consisted of just me, my two new friends, and my lecturer. I feel very comfortable studying that stems from their sociability and enthusiasm. I knew that the majority of subjects in my major are usually collaborative working, so I thought I should make a group right now with two new friends in my class. Unfortunately, although they are my classmates at the moment, my major is Robotics and Mechatronics engineering, both of them are Software engineering. Therefore, we are just able to be a group in this course. Nevertheless, I am still very glad when I am studying and collaborating with them because they are very kind and willing to support others. Additionally, our specialty is correlated with each other. I hope we can continue cooperating learning in the future, that would be helpful for us when exchanging knowledge and novelty in technological domains.
 
            Moreover, I assume that the Introduction to SAT course is an opportunity for me to train and accomplish myself to adapt to the university atmosphere. Firstly, English is a required language in my college, so I still have a bit of time in this course to enhance my language from my lectures, lecturers, and my friends because obviously in my major there are a lot of weird languages like technique words, acronym, or common words for learning. Secondly, I have acquired numerous skills to serve my studies like collaborative working (that I may use commonly in my major), writing, and research skills. I have a friend who is like-minded like me but now he has begun the first subjects. He recommended I should study and research programming before I approach them in the next course because it is an essential skill in my specialty and quite complicated. Fortunately, my lecturer this semester also introduces programming such as programming applications and basic recipes. There are these things that I was advised to prepare for these first steps in higher education. Therefore, relationships are a factor for academic success, we can ask for advice from the previous generation and exchange knowledge with them. Also, specifically in my major, collaborative working is common, so having many relationships in the same specialty will have a number of advantages in teamwork including restricting the waste of time to find teammates and easier to connect and communicate with them.
