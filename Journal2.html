<h2>Journal Entry 2</h2>   
       <p>Currently, I am studying the second subject in the first semester that is Introduction to Science and Technology. This class consisted of just me, my two new friends, and my lecturer. I feel very comfortable studying that stems from their sociability and enthusiasm. I knew that the majority of subjects in my major are usually collaborative working, so I thought I should make a group right now with two new friends in my class. Unfortunately, although they are my classmates at the moment, my major is Robotics and Mechatronics engineering, both of them are Software engineering. Therefore, we are just able to be a group in this course. Nevertheless, I am still very glad when I am studying and collaborating with them because they are very kind and willing to support others. Additionally, our specialty is correlated with each other. I hope we can continue cooperating learning in the future, that would be helpful for us when exchanging knowledge and novelty in technological domains.</p>
           <p>Moreover, I assume that the Introduction to SAT course is an opportunity for me to train and accomplish myself to adapt to the university atmosphere. Firstly, English is a required language in my college, so I still have a bit of time in this course to enhance my language from my lectures, lecturers, and my friends because obviously in my major there are a lot of weird languages like technique words, acronym, or common words for learning. Secondly, I have acquired numerous skills to serve my studies like collaborative working (that I may use commonly in my major), writing, and research skills. I have a friend who is like-minded like me but now he has begun the first subjects. He recommended I should study and research programming before I approach them in the next course because it is an essential skill in my specialty and quite complicated. Fortunately, my lecturer this semester also introduces programming such as programming applications and basic recipes. There are these things that I was advised to prepare for these first steps in higher education. Therefore, relationships are a factor for academic success, we can ask for advice from the previous generation and exchange knowledge with them. Also, specifically in my major, collaborative working is common, so having many relationships in the same specialty will have a number of advantages in teamwork including restricting the waste of time to find teammates and easier to connect and communicate with them.</p>
