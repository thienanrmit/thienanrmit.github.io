    <h2>Journal Entry 1</h2>
       <p>My intention after graduating high school was to study medicine under the direction of my parents. However, I recognized that my passion branch in science and technology. From when I was a child until now, I feel excited when I watch channels relevant to technology like car manufacturing or AI, which is very cool. Fortunately, my parents also approved my determination and chose RMIT because they heard that the facilities at RMIT are very modern and appropriate for this major. It would be an opportunity for me to become a qualified engineer and have a favorable career path.</p>
           <p>Since I have begun entry to the RMIT campus, it is indeed more imposing than I imagined. In the first days when I experience studying here, I am surprised and highly enthusiastic to see a lot of technological conveniences are available equipped on campus such as numerous high-ends computer labs where every RMIT student are allowed to use and labs for each major, especially is IT and engineering labs where I will stick regularly during college. The majority are located in building 2 and 8 on campus. Particularly, not everyone is allowed to use these function rooms for safety reasons. Therefore, I and all the engineering students are required to accomplish Organizational Health & Safety (OH&S). Then, I will receive the access card to enter these rooms. This training is extremely important and useful because accidents in labs are commonly happening such as electric shocks, burns caused by fire, bleeding from cutting, or stepping on a sharp object. Throughout this, I can learn how to avoid misfortune and first aid techniques when I confront these circumstances. Not only position of strength about facilities but also study support services like Student Academic Success (SAS) or library. I can contact lecturers on these services to get support or booking appointments with them. Also, I can access SAS and the library website to get information. For example, when I donâ€™t know how to make citations and references, I can seek guidance from easy cities on the library website. Additionally, the NEO culture tech club and student developer club are typical organizations on the campus where I can engage to exchange knowledge about my specialty and to entertain.</p>
           
           <p>In brief, through several courses in RMIT, I have discovered many new things for me and that will be helpful for my educational paths in the future.
